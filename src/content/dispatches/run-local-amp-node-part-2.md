[Part 1](/dispatches/run-local-amp-node/) covered installing ampd, pointing it at an Arbitrum One RPC, and deploying a dataset. This post is about what happens next: what Amp actually writes to disk, what it costs in RAM, and the operational details the setup docs don't mention. Numbers in this post are from my node, running on a ThinkPad indexing Arbitrum One for the last 24 hours.

## What Amp actually stores

If you thought Amp only stores the events you care about, it doesn't. It stores the entire chain: every block, every transaction, every log from every contract. Your contract filter is a query-time concern, not an indexing-time one.

The data lives under `data_dir` (in Part 1's config, `/var/lib/ampd/data`) as three parquet-backed tables per dataset:

```
/var/lib/ampd/data/arbitrum_one/
├── blocks/<partition-uuid>/<start_block>-<hash>.parquet
├── transactions/<partition-uuid>/<start_block>-<hash>.parquet
└── logs/<partition-uuid>/<start_block>-<hash>.parquet
```

After one day of indexing Arbitrum One from block 453,055,204:

| Table | Size | What's in it |
|---|---|---|
| blocks | 1.2 GB | Every block header (hash, parent, miner, gas, roots, base fee, blob fields) |
| transactions | 1.6 GB | Every tx (calldata, gas, access list, auth list, from/to, status) |
| logs | 979 MB | Every event from every contract (4 topics + data) |
| **Total** | **3.7 GB** | |

Compression is `zstd(1)` (configured in `ampd.toml` under `[writer]`). Files are small, 5 to 15 KB each, one per ~5-block range. After 24 hours my node had 295,074 parquet files across the three tables.

On the file layout: each table has a single partition directory (a UUIDv7), and files inside it are named `<start_block>-<fragment-hash>.parquet`. This makes it trivial to tell at a glance what block range any file covers, which is useful later when we talk about retention.

## Storage projection

At 3.7 GB/day for Arbitrum One:

- ~110 GB/month
- ~1.3 TB/year
- ~240M blocks from HorizonStaking genesis (June 2024) would take weeks of wall-clock time and hundreds of GB on top of the tip-tracking growth

On picking a start block: unless you actually need pre-genesis history, start somewhere sensible. The `deploy/reindex-jan2026.sh` script in my repo uses block 416,000,000 (Jan 2026) and that covers the HorizonStaking launch period while keeping the initial sync to a few days.

## RAM: the VSZ number is lying to you

`htop` on my node shows ampd using 284 GB of virtual memory on a laptop that only has 62 GB. This is not a bug and not a leak: it's the parquet files being memory-mapped. Linux counts every mmapped page as part of the process's virtual address space, even though physical memory is only consumed for pages actually touched.

The number that matters is RSS:

```
$ ps -o pid,rss,vsz,pmem,comm -p $(pgrep ampd)
    PID    RSS     VSZ %MEM COMMAND
1195749 9077088 284121932 13.8 ampd
```

9 GB RSS, 13.8% of total RAM. RSS will grow slowly as more parquet pages are read (for queries) but the kernel evicts cold pages under pressure, so this isn't unbounded.

On minimum RAM: Part 1 said 16 GB and I still stand by that; you want headroom for Postgres, query bursts, and the page cache doing its job. Going below isn't worth the grief.

## Retention: there is none (and that's fine for now)

A natural question after one day of seeing 3.7 GB go by is: "can I keep only the last month?" The honest answer is no, not natively. I checked:

- `ampctl dataset/job/manifest` subcommands, where `prune` exists but only for orphaned jobs and manifests, not partition data
- The admin API on `:1610`: no retention, ttl, delete-partition, or equivalent
- The upstream repo: no docs, no flags, no open issues proposing it

So your options are:

1. **Do nothing.** At 3.7 GB/day on a 2 TB disk, you have ~14 months of runway. For a hobby node this is fine; you can revisit when it becomes a real problem.
2. **Periodic stop + redeploy.** Cron a monthly job that runs `stop.sh` and redeploys with `start_block = tip - 21.6M` (30 days of Arbitrum blocks at ~4 blocks/s). Clean but creates a sync gap each cycle.
3. **Manual parquet deletion.** Files are named by start_block so you could `find … -name "N-*.parquet"` and delete them. The Postgres metadata still references those ranges though, so queries against deleted blocks will behave unpredictably. Don't ship this.

If you do nothing and the project ships retention in the next 12 months, you've won for free.

## The admin API nobody documents

`ampd solo --admin-server` exposes a local HTTP API on `:1610`. It's not in the public docs but it's how you poke at live state without grepping journald. The useful endpoints I've found:

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /jobs` | All jobs, status, dataset, manifest hash |
| `GET /datasets` | Registered datasets + versions |
| `GET /manifests` | All registered manifest hashes |
| `GET /manifests/<hash>` | Full manifest JSON: schema, start_block, network |
| `GET /workers` | Worker nodes (just one in solo mode) |

One-liner to see your current sync frontier without tailing logs:

```bash
journalctl -u ampd -n 1 --no-pager -g "Fetching blocks" \
  | grep -oP 'end_block=\K\d+'
```

Or the wall-clock-accurate version via the admin API + your RPC:

```bash
# Latest block we've indexed (read from the most recent log line)
# vs. chain tip (read from your RPC provider)
# delta / 4 = seconds behind tip
```

## Exposing to Vercel without a public IP

Part 1 had nginx with `listen 1604` and implied you'd put a public IP + domain + certbot in front of it. That's one way. The easier way for a laptop behind a home router is a Cloudflare tunnel: no port forwarding, no static IP, no certs to rotate.

```bash
# Install
yay -S cloudflared   # or apt install cloudflared

# Login (opens a browser, pick your Cloudflare domain)
cloudflared tunnel login

# Create + run a named tunnel pointing at local nginx
cloudflared tunnel create amp
cloudflared tunnel route dns amp amp.yourdomain.com
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:1604 run amp
```

Run it as a systemd user service so it survives reboots. Set `AMP_ENDPOINT=https://amp.yourdomain.com` in your Vercel env and the `X-Amp-Token` auth from Part 1 works unchanged: the token travels end-to-end, the tunnel is just transport.

One gotcha: when the tunnel hostname changes (e.g. you recreated the tunnel), you need to update the Vercel env var and redeploy. I keep an `update-tunnel.sh` that does both via `vercel env` + `vercel --prod`.

## RPC is still the only bottleneck that matters

At tip, ampd keeps up with Arbitrum block production 1:1, about 4 blocks/second, which is the chain's native rate. My 24-hour node indexed 337,091 blocks in 23.5 hours of wall-clock time. That's the steady state; you're paying RPC costs, not local compute.

What this means in practice:

- **At-tip indexing on Chainstack Growth**: free, you're nowhere near the 250 req/s ceiling.
- **Backfilling from weeks ago**: RPC-bound. A rough ceiling is a few hundred blocks/second if the RPC cooperates, much less if it throttles. Budget accordingly.
- **Adding a second provider file does nothing.** I confirmed this: ampd uses one provider at a time per dataset, there's no round-robin across files in the `providers_dir`.

If you need faster backfills, the only real lever is a local Arbitrum Nitro node. For tip-tracking, a paid RPC plan is plenty.

## Gotchas v2

New ones I hit in the first week that weren't in Part 1:

- **VSZ is not memory.** htop will show ampd using hundreds of GB. It's mmap. Look at RSS.
- **`ampctl job prune` does not delete partition data.** The name implies it might. It only removes finished job rows from Postgres. The parquet files are untouched.
- **100M+ inodes per year.** ext4 handles it, but `cp -r` on the data dir will take forever if you ever migrate. Use `rsync -a` or `mv` within the same filesystem.
- **File ownership is `ampd:ampd`, not root.** If you ran the install as root and chown'd things wrong, the daemon will silently fail to write parquets. Check `journalctl -u ampd` for permission errors first when things go sideways.
- **A running job survives `systemctl stop ampd`.** Jobs live in Postgres with their own checkpoint; restarting the daemon resumes them. To stop indexing, use `ampctl job stop <id>`.

## What you can build with a day of data

Even with just 24 hours of chain history, the queries from Part 1's HorizonStaking framing are already useful:

- **Live provision dashboard**: every `ProvisionCreated`/`ProvisionIncreased`/`ProvisionThawed` in the last day, refreshed on each page load
- **Delegation flow**: net `TokensDelegated` minus `TokensUndelegated` per indexer per hour
- **Slashing watch**: poll `ProvisionSlashed` + `DelegationSlashed` on a cron and alert
- **Event replay**: any transaction hash → its full log trail, without calling the RPC

The subgraph will still tell you the current state more cheaply. What Amp gives you is the shape of the state change, not "this indexer has X stake" but "this indexer got X stake from these addresses across these blocks." That's the whole pitch for running one of these.
